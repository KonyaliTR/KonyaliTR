Hey, I'm @KonyaliTR
I am from Turkey and I speak Turkish and English.
I have been around the internet and also GitHub for a long time, however this account is not really old.
I am very inquisitive and spent almost all my youth on the internet.
To be honest, I do very little open source, but plan to make a change.
At the moment I am interested in the following things: Reverse Engineering C#, JS VMS
